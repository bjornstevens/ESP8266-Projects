# ESP8266-Projects
Different projects for ESP8266 that you can use!


The first file has been uploaded. This is a file that receives 433mhz code from domoticz to turn a light/switch on or off. The code is a tri-state code.
Feel free to ask me questions how to integrate.

For more info look at the screenshots.
